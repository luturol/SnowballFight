    I've found a bug when the player collides to a platform he get stuck. To solve this go to Assets -> Create -> Physical Material 2D and add 0 to friction, then add this material to the platforms.

ANIMATIONS ARE REAL

You'll learn how to add animations to your game and how to turn your player to another size, if you look to way it is then will see the character does not face the other side when press to run left.

Animation involves others sprites "movements" then adding how much time it will last until it's over and adding parameters to set when it will be running or jumping.
